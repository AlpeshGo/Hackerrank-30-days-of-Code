#Task:
Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:
1. If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.: fine = 0).
2. If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date,"fine = 15 Hackos *(number of days late)".
3. If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the "fine = 5000 Hackos *(number of months late)"
4. If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of 10000 Hackos.

#Input:
STDIN       Function
-----       --------
9 6 2015    day = 9, month = 6, year = 2015 (date returned)
6 6 2015    day = 6, month = 6, year = 2015 (date due)

#Output:
45

#Solution:
return_day, return_month, return_year = [int(e) for e in input().strip().split(' ')]
due_day, due_month, due_year = [int(e) for e in input().strip().split(' ')]

#check the biggest cateogry first
if return_year < due_year:
    print(0)
elif return_year == due_year:
    #Check Month
    if return_month < due_month:
        print(0)
    elif return_month == due_month:
        #Check day
        if return_day <= due_day:
            print(0)
        else:
            print(15 * (return_day - due_day))
    else:
        print(500 * (return_month - due_month))
else:
    print(10000)
