#Task
Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:
-If n is odd, print Weird
-If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
-If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
-If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

#Input:
3
24

#Solution:
import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys
if __name__ == '__main__':
    N = int(input().strip())
if N % 2 != 0:
    print("Weird")
else:
    if N <= 5:
        print("Not Weird")
    elif N <= 20:
        print("Weird")
    else:
        print("Not Weird")

#Output:
