#Task:
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.
Example:
Meal cost :100
Tip percent: 15
Tax percent : 8
A tip of 15% * 100 = 15, and the taxes are 8% * 100 = 8. Print the value 123 and return from the function.

#Input:
12.00
20
8

#Solution:

def solve(meal_cost, tip_percent, tax_percent):
    # Write your code here
    total_cost =  meal_cost + meal_cost * tip_percent/100 + meal_cost * tax_percent/100
    print(round(total_cost))
if __name__ == '__main__':
    meal_cost = float(input().strip())

    tip_percent = int(input().strip())

    tax_percent = int(input().strip())

    solve(meal_cost, tip_percent, tax_percent)

#Output:
15
